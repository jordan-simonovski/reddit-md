# reddit-md

Little side-project I'm working on using Material AngularJS and NodeJS. Working on parsing the reddit json in my node server and pushing through very basic Title+link stuff at the moment using a card/list design; but I'm thinking of eventually making it all front-end. NodeJS is mostly serving as a way for me to play around with services.

## Installation
This is pretty straightforward:
1. Go to where you've cloned the repository using a command line tool and enter "npm install"
2. Once all of your dependencies have downloaded enter "npm start"

## Screenshot

I've added a screenshot for those of you who don't want to run the server.
