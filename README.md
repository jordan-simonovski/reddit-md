# reddit-md

Little side-project I'm working on using Material AngularJS and NodeJS. Working on parsing the reddit json in my node server and pushing through very basic Title+link stuff at the moment using a card/list design; but I'm thinking of eventually making it all front-end. NodeJS is mostly serving as a way for me to play around with services.

## Installation
This is pretty straightforward:

```
#go to where you've cloned the directory and enter
npm install

#this should install all ofthe dependencies in order for the server to run. Then you execute
npm start

#this should start the server on port 3000. Access the site by going to http://localhost:3000
``` 

## Screenshot

I've added a screenshot for those of you who don't want to run the server.
