# reddit-md
Little side-project I'm working on using Material AngularJS and NodeJS. Working on parsing the reddit json in my node server and pushing through very basic Title+link stuff at the moment using a card/list design; but I'm thinking of eventually making it all front-end. NodeJS is mostly serving as a way for me to play around with services.
